When working with Next.js, always call the init tool from next-devtools-mcp
at the start of the session to establish proper context and documentation requirements.

Code style preferences:

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use async/await instead of .then() chains

Testing requirements:

- Write unit tests for all utility functions
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component tests

Branch naming convention:

- Format: `feature/CHA-{issue-number}-{issue-title-slug}`
- Where CHA stands for chatati, followed by the GitHub issue number, then a slugified version of the issue title
- Example: `feature/CHA-1-finish-login-flow`
- Always create branches based on GitHub issues and use this naming convention

Referring to documentation: use context7
