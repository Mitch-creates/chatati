When working with Next.js, always call the init tool from next-devtools-mcp
at the start of the session to establish proper context and documentation requirements.

Code style preferences:
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use async/await instead of .then() chains

Testing requirements:
- Write unit tests for all utility functions
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for component tests
